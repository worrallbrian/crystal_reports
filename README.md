# This repository contains multiple sample SAP Crystal Reports (rpt) files. It also contains the BWPortfolio database (mdb, data source for the included SAP Crystal Reports files).

# AlphaISOsByCountry.rpt, ColourPaletteSampler.rpt, CountriesAndCapitolsOfTheWorld.rpt, MajorCitiesInCanadaUSAandMexico.rpt, MostRecentStructuringOfCanadianCities.rpt, PinkPaletteSampler.rpt, SportsTeams.rpt, SportsTeams_TorontoOnly.rpt, USStatesWithAbbreviations.rpt
# BWPortfolio.mdb

# Connecting the BWPortfolio data source to SAP Crystal Reports may require installing a new driver.

# Table linkage, colour rendering, native sorting, and trial version issues prevented further exploration of the BWPortfolio data source.

# Thanks to Wikipedia for public domain USA Flag image used on USStatesWithAbbreviations.rpt

# Kudos and professional connections are appreciated :)
